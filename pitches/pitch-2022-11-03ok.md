# autonomy 

Reminders can be a daily need to take care of yourself. This is the case of the Dexcom application, an application for people with diabetes.  

The idea is to help the patient become more independent to his disease through a more poetic interaction between the application and him. 
This could go through sensory interactions, colors, new shapes, new textures.  

This work aims to demonize the disease to try to make it more acceptable and less burdensome.
