Reminders can be a daily need to take care of yourself. This is the case of the Dexcom application, an application for people with diabetes. 

This application calculates the glycemic index in real time and sends notifications to warn / anticipate / remind / alert / the patient.

The idea is to help the patient to accept and understand his disease through a more poetic interaction between the application and the patient.
