# REMINDER : sets an alert

I find it interesting how people correlate time with objects or actions related to objects, to ritualize their days. Everyone's day is ritualized and ordered in a desired or undesired way according to pre-established or random and usually routine events. 
It is therefore punctually governed by these events, often intimately linked to objects. 

How can we precisely understand this need and/or this necessity to materialize time? 

It would be relevant to focus on a the habit of reminders and alerts to create a poetic object that interprets this need.
