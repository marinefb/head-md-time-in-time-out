# What I learned 


* The importance of choosing good textures, textiles and materials for the object,

* Create a coherent universe between the shape of the textile objet (color, textile) and external elements

* Think about the meaning given to the charger

* Faking the glycemic sensor with potentiometer is relevant and can be easier and more meaningful for the final prototype (but the potentiometer can be replaced by the sensor when possible because the principle is the same).

* The lights on the butterflyâ€™s wing may not be necessary. Maybe a iridescent fabric is enough with an LED color code on the body which already says a lot.

* Think about shades of color
